## 📖 Overview

This repository is a **learning and reference resource** for teams adopting GitHub Copilot's extensibility features — from custom agents and MCP servers to the Copilot CLI and agentic workflows.

The centerpiece is an **interactive 33-slide presentation** covering the full spectrum of Copilot capabilities: skills, custom instructions, Model Context Protocol, the autonomous coding agent, orchestration patterns, and CLI customization. It's designed for internal training, workshops, and self-paced learning.

The repo also includes an **agentic workflow** that automatically researches the latest Copilot updates and proposes content changes via pull requests — keeping the materials current without manual effort.

## ⚡ Quick Start

**View the presentation** — no build step or server required:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url> && cd ghcp-learning-updates

# Open the slide deck
open presentation.html        # macOS
start presentation.html       # Windows
xdg-open presentation.html    # Linux
```

### ⌨️ Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` / `→` | Navigate between slides |

## 🔄 Agentic Workflow — Docs Research Updater

An automated GitHub Actions workflow researches the latest Copilot updates and creates PRs with proposed content changes.

### What It Does

- **Daily schedule** — Automatically runs on a cadence to check for new Copilot features and documentation changes
- **On-demand** — Can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
- **Research sources** — Scans official GitHub blogs, Copilot docs, changelogs, and release notes
- **PR creation** — Proposes updates as pull requests for human review

### Setup

1. **Install the `gh-aw` extension** (GitHub Agentic Workflows CLI):
   ```bash
   gh extension install github/gh-aw
   ```

2. **Compile the workflow:**
   ```bash
   gh aw compile .github/workflows/docs-research-updater.md
   ```

3. **Configure secrets** — Ensure required secrets (e.g., `GITHUB_TOKEN` with appropriate permissions) are set in your repository settings.

### Manual Trigger

```bash
gh workflow run docs-research-updater
```

## 🛠️ Custom Agent — `agentic-workflows-builder`

An expert agent for designing, building, and deploying GitHub Copilot agentic workflows. Installed at the **user profile level** so it's available across all repositories.

### Location

```
~/.copilot/agents/agentic-workflows-builder.agent.md
```

### Usage

```bash
# In GitHub Copilot CLI or VS Code chat:
/agent agentic-workflows-builder

# Or reference by name in any prompt:
"Use the agentic-workflows-builder agent to scaffold a new custom agent"
```

### Capabilities

- Creating custom agents (`.agent.md` files)
- Writing prompt files (`.prompt.md`)
- Configuring MCP servers
- Setting up agent orchestration patterns (sequential, parallel, handoff)
- Building skills and custom instructions

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions to keep this resource current are welcome!

### Adding or Updating Slides

1. Open `presentation.html` in a text editor
2. Each slide is a `<section>` element — add new slides following the existing pattern
3. Update the section navigation pills if adding a new section
4. Test in a browser to verify layout and transitions

### Updating the Agentic Workflow

1. Edit `.github/workflows/docs-research-updater.md`
2. Recompile with `gh aw compile .github/workflows/docs-research-updater.md`
3. Test with a manual `workflow_dispatch` run

### General Guidelines

- Keep slides concise — use bullet points and code snippets over long paragraphs
- Test keyboard navigation after changes
- Speaker notes are a great place for detailed talking points
